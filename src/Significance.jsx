There are several legends that explain in detail the origin of Chhath Puja. It is believed that in ancient times,
 Draupadi and the Pandavas of Hastinapur used to celebrate Chhath in order to solve their issues and gain their lost
  kingdom again. A few mantras from the Rig Veda texts are chanted by worshippers while offering prayers to the Sun.

According to another legend, Chhath Puja was first performed by Karna, who is considered to be an offspring of Lord 
Surya and Kunti. He ruled over the Anga Desh which is the modern-day Bhagalpur in Bihar, during the age of Mahabharata.

As per a legend, Chhath Puja is being performed from the Early Vedic Period. The legend has it that the sages of that
era used to perform the puja by exposing themselves to direct sunlight to gain energy from the rays of the Sun and
did not consume any eatables.
